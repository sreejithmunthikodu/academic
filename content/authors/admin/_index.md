Sreejith Munthikodu is a Master of Data Science candidate at the University of British Columbia. Previously he was a MASc student at the University of victoria, where he worked on pattern recognition and real-time pattern prediction task on drviving cycles to support an intelligent energy management strategy for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles. In his research work, he used Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm algorithm to perform pattern recognition and Artificial Neural Networks to perform real-time pattern prediction. 

He worked as a Machine learning intern at a startup named Hypernose, based on Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.
